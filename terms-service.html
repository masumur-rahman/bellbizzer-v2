                        <h1>Terms for Borrowers</h1>

                        <p>As a borrower (<b>“Borrower”</b>) of a Loaned Item, you are responsible to the owner (<b>“Lender”</b>) for the Loaned Item while it is in your possession.</p>

                        <p>Fees. Borrower is responsible for paying all fees when they come due. Borrower will be responsible for all of costs (e.g. repair costs) incurred during the period Borrower has the Loaned Item in its possession.</p>

                        <p>Your Financial Responsibility Is Primary. With regard to damage, losses, or other liabilities, you acknowledge that, where permissible under applicable law, you are primarily liable for your liabilities under the Agreement, though you may fund that primary liability via any personal insurance you have available to you as the primary source of funds.  You acknowledge that you are fully responsible for any damage, losses, or other liabilities relating to your activities through the Services. You agree that in the event damage is reported, BellBizzer may immediately charge you up to the replacement value of the Loaned Item.  Nothing in this Agreement is intended to limit your responsibilities or BellBizzer's legal rights in connection with your use of the Services. You acknowledge that BellBizzer may require and hold a deposit as part of the reservation of a Loaned Item.</p>

                        <p>Damage.  You are fully responsible for paying any damage to the Loaned Item as well as fees, expenses, liens, or fines arising out of your use of a Loaned Item booked through BellBizzer. If BellBizzer advances any payment on your behalf, you will continue to be responsible for such amounts and will adhere to BellBizzer’s schedule for repayment of those amounts to BellBizzer.</p>

                        <p>Use of the Loaned Item. When you book a Loaned Item from a Lender through BellBizzer, you must use the Loaned Item only for your personal use and not for any commercial purposes unless you have express written permission from BellBizzer in advance. You may not access a Loaned Item until the beginning of your reservation period, and you must return the Loaned Item on time and in the correct location. You must present the Lender with a current, valid form of photo identification. You must exercise reasonable care in your use of the Loaned Item. You are required at all times to operate the Loaned Item safely, and in compliance with all applicable laws. In the event BellBizzer has any concern about your use of a Loaned Item, BellBizzer may terminate your reservation in its discretion at any time and require the return of the Loaned Item, including recovering the Loaned Item on behalf of the Lender. You are required to have reasonable safety equipment during the operation of the Loaned Item. You are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom you permit to use or otherwise access the Loaned Item.  You are also required to meet any laws or regulations concerning child safety or other protections for children.</p>

                        <p>Condition of the Loaned Item. You understand that Lenders own the Loaned Items.  Each Lender is responsible for complying with all legal requirements and maintaining their Loaned Item(s) in safe condition. Please complete a visual inspection before you begin your use of the Loaned Item. If you find damage in your initial inspection, you should upload photos of such pre-existing damage at the start of your reservation to ensure you are not held responsible for pre-existing damage. Please send any evidence of pre-existing damage to BellBizzer at <a href="mailto:info@bellbizzer.com">info@bellbizzer.com</a>  If you find damage on your initial inspection and fail to report it, BellBizzer or our third party administrators may assume that the damage occurred during your reservation period. If, after your initial inspection, you believe that the Loaned Item is not safe please do not use the Loaned Item; and in that event, please contact the BellBizzer team immediately at <a href="mailto:info@bellbizzer.com">info@bellbizzer.com</a></p>

                        <p>Repossession. BellBizzer, a hired agent of BellBizzer, or the Lender may repossess any Loaned Item booked through the Services without demand, at the Borrower’s expense, if the Loaned Item is not returned by the end of the reservation or used in violation of applicable law or this Agreement.</p>

                        <p>Missing Loaned Items. If a Loaned Item you have booked through the Services goes missing and/or is stolen during the reservation period (or extension period), you must immediately file a police report after discovering the Loaned Item is missing or stolen, but in no event more than 24 hours after discovering it has gone missing; and cooperate fully with the Lender, law enforcement, BellBizzer, and other authorities in all matters related to the investigation.</p>

                        <h1>Terms for Owners</h1>

                        <p>The following Sections also apply if, as a Lender, you share your Loaned Item through the Services:</p>

                        <p><i>Listing</i> the Loaned Item. When you use the Services, you will identify Loaned Item(s) that you want to list for sharing through the Services. Each Loaned Item must be in good working order. You may only use the Services in connection with Loaned Items that you own or otherwise have all the necessary rights and permissions to share for compensation.</p>

                        <p><i>Availability.</i> Once a Loaned Item is booked, you must make the Loaned Item available or deliver the Loaned Item as expected by the Borrower. If you offer the Borrower the option to pick up your Loaned Item at a specified location, you must supply the location of the Loaned Item accurately to BellBizzer and ensure that the Loaned Item is available at that location at the beginning of the reservation period.  Before you provide the Borrower your Loaned Item, ensure the Borrower’s photo identification matches the name on the reservation.</p>

                        <p><i>Maintenance.</i> You are required to regularly check your Loaned Item for any defects in its operations or safety. You promise that, at all times, your Loaned Item will be operating within normal safety parameters, in good mechanical condition, and in full compliance with all applicable inspection and registration requirements.  You agree to respond to any applicable recall or similar safety notices and to complete any recommended action before allowing your Loaned Item to be booked. In addition, if BellBizzer believes that your Loaned Item does not conform to reasonable standards, BellBizzer may notify you and reserves the right to remove or decline listing your Loaned Item until its concerns have been resolved. BellBizzer may, but does not commit to, undertake efforts to ensure the safety of Loaned Items booked through the Services.</p>

                        <p><i>Incident Reporting.</i> If you believe that a Borrower has caused any damage to your Loaned Item, you are required to report that damage as soon as you become aware of it (and in any event, no more than 24 hours after the scheduled end of reservation) and to provide reasonable cooperation in the investigation of the damage.  Based on the investigation, BellBizzer will reasonably determine whether the damage occurred during the reservation period.  If BellBizzer determines the damage occurred during the reservation period, you will be reimbursed for the loss as described in the sections below. If BellBizzer is not given prompt notice as described in this paragraph, or if you do not provide reasonable cooperation in the investigation by BellBizzer, we may not be able to determine the cause of the damage. In that case, you agree that we may decline any financial responsibility for such damage.</p>

                        <p><i>Damage Exclusions.</i>  You should expect normal wear and tear on your Loaned Item, including minor scrapes and dings, in connection with your participation in the Services. BellBizzer will not reimburse you for normal wear and tear to your Loaned Item.</p>

                        <p><i>Compliance with Laws.</i>  You agree to comply with any and all applicable laws and regulations, including applicable registration and minimum insurance requirements, for your Loaned Item.</p>

                        <p><i>Reimbursement by BellBizzer.</i>  In the event a Borrower damages or destroys a Loaned Item, BellBizzer, in its sole discretion, may offer to pay up to $1,000 of the Loaned Item’s value to the Lender.  The foregoing sentence is not a guarantee of recompense by BellBizzer for damaged or destroyed Loaned Items.</p>
